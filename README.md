Riddle #2
What is the smallest natural number where the result of moving the digit on the far right to the front of the number is a number 9 times greater?

Similarly, for 142857, when you move the rightmost digit to the first place, it becomes 714285, which is the original number times 5.

Keep in mind:
- In this puzzle, you need the number to become the original times 9.
- Provide your answer using digits only â€“ no spaces, letters, symbols, etc.
